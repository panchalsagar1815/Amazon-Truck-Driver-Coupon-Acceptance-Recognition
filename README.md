# Amazon-Truck-Driver-Coupon-Acceptance-Recognition

The "Amazon Truck Driver Coupon Acceptance Recognition" project is a sophisticated analysis aimed at understanding the factors influencing truck drivers' acceptance of coupons during their journeys. The project explores a rich dataset that includes various features such as destination, passenger details, weather conditions, temperature, time of day, coupon information (expiration, type), demographic details (gender, age, marital status, presence of children), educational background, occupation, income, and details about the driver's vehicle.

Utilizing advanced statistical methods and data visualization techniques through the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries, the project provides a comprehensive overview of the relationships between these diverse factors. Through graphical representations, trends and patterns are visually identified, offering valuable insights into the decision-making process of truck drivers regarding coupon acceptance.

The project employs two classification algorithms, Random Forest and KNN, to predict whether truck drivers are likely to accept coupons based on the provided features. This predictive modelling approach enhances our ability to anticipate coupon acceptance behaviour and provides a practical tool for optimizing coupon distribution strategies.
